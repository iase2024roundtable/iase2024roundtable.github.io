## Organisers

The [International Association for Statistical Education (IASE)](https://iase-web.org/), is the international umbrella organisation for statistics education, and is the education section of the [International Statistical Institute (ISI)](https://isi-web.org/). 

IASE seeks to promote, support and improve statistical education at all levels around the world, and help the understanding and use of information involving statistics and probability. IASE fosters international cooperation, stimulates discussion and encourages and publishes relevant research. It disseminates ideas, strategies, research findings, materials, educational resources and information via its publications, international conferences, and websites.

IASE meetings are lively, informal gatherings that draw together many people, professionals and students interested in the learning, teaching, and understanding of statistics and probability at schools and universities, in the workplace, and in professional and societal contexts, whether as part of statistics education, mathematics or science education, in connection with the work of official statistics agencies and other data producers, and in many other contexts.

Visit the [IASE website](https://iase-web.org/) to find out more about IASE and its activities. Join IASE to network with the world-wide statistics education community and obtain discounted registration to all international activities of IASE.
