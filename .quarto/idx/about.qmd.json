IASE fosters international cooperation, stimulates discussion and encourages and publishes relevant research. It disseminates ideas, strategies, research findings, materials, educational resources and information via its publications, international conferences, and websites.\n\nIASE meetings are lively, informal gatherings that draw together many people, professionals and students interested in the learning, teaching, and understanding of statistics and probability at schools and universities, in the workplace, and in professional and societal contexts, whether as part of statistics education, mathematics or science education, in connection with the work of official statistics agencies and other data producers, and in many other contexts.\n\nVisit the [IASE website](https://iase-web.org/) to find out more about IASE and its activities. Join IASE to network with the world-wide statistics education community and obtain discounted registration to all international activities of IASE.\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of the following organisations:\n\n - The [International Statistical Institute (ISI)](https://www.isi-web.org/)\n - The [Te Kura Tatauranga | Department of Statistics, Waipapa Taumata Rau | University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/department-of-statistics.html)\n - The [New Zealand Statistical Association (NZSA)](https://www.stats.org.nz/)"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","include-in-header":["extra_code.html"],"include-before-body":["header.html"],"css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","page-layout":"full","title-block-banner":false,"theme":"flatly.scss","mainfont":"Tahoma","grid":{"sidebar-width":"0px","body-width":"1000px","margin-width":"0px","gutter-width":"1.5rem"},"title":"About the roundtable conference"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
