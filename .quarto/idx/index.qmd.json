The conference will be in person. Previous IASE Roundtables have brought 40-50 folks from around the world and the host country to share their passion, expertise, and experiences in statistics and data science education.\n\nThe four-day Roundtable will focus on a unique theme: \"**Connecting data and people for inclusive statistics and data science education**\". Given that the creation and use of data is a human-driven process, this conference aims to discuss the inclusivity of the teaching and learning experiences for both students and teachers within statistics and data science.\n\nWe invite you to participate in this roundtable conference, to join us in sharing knowledge, questions, and ideas that enable us to learn from the work of colleagues from around the world and help to advance statistics and data science education. The conference program will be a mixture of papers, workshops, and poster sessions, coupled with opportunities for conversation in person.\n:::\n\n::: g-col-3\n![](images/conf_logo.png){fig-alt=\"Conference logo showing diverse people icons connected together\"}\n:::\n:::\n\n## Participate in IASE 2024\n\nIt is possible to participate in the Roundtable in one of four roles: Paper presenter, Workshop organiser, Poster presenter; or Discussant leader. Papers are submitted and shared before the conference, and roundtables are (literally) formed for discussions and constructive feedback during the conference. Workshops and poster presentations provide further opportunities for discussing and reflecting on statistics and data science education. Discussant leaders should be statistics educators at any level, developers of educational technology, developers of statistics curricula, students of statistics education, or scholars in education or statistics with experience in statistics education.\n\nWe are now accepting applications for contributions to the IASE 2024 Roundtable. Please review the [Themes and papers page](themes.qmd) to find out more about how to make a submission.\n\n## ICME\n\nThe IASE Roundtable comes just before the [15th International Congress on Mathematical Education](https://icme15.org/).\n\n![](images/icme.png)\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support and sponsorship of the following organisations:\n\n- The [International Statistical Institute (ISI)](https://www.isi-web.org/)\n- The [New Zealand Statistical Association](https://www.stats.org.nz/)\n\n::: grid\n\n::: g-col-4\n\n![](images/isi-logo.png)\n:::\n::: g-col-4\n\n:::\n::: g-col-4\n\n![](images/nzsa.png)\n:::\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","include-in-header":["extra_code.html"],"include-before-body":["header.html"],"css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","page-layout":"full","title-block-banner":false,"theme":"flatly.scss","mainfont":"Tahoma","grid":{"sidebar-width":"0px","body-width":"1000px","margin-width":"0px","gutter-width":"1.5rem"},"title":"Kia ora tātou!
