By exploring of the many ways data and people are connected, it is hoped we can generate inclusive approaches that: \n\n- support students with diverse needs and physical challenges, \n- acknowledge and validate indigenous and cultural knowledges related to data, \n- address the impact of social and economic factors,\n- consider creative ways to support learners within under resourced contexts,\n- challenge the status quo and inherent biases,\n- take an interdisciplinary perspective,\n- inform the design of digital tools or resources, tasks, and modern learning - environments, and\n- take a humanistic stance.\n\nThrough a mixture of formats including extensive discussions in small groups, the meeting will advance current knowledge about conceptual frameworks, teaching methods, technology solutions, and curricular materials.\n\n*Topics to be updated*\n\n## Key dates\n\n*To be updated*\n\n## Papers, workshops, and posters\n\n*To be updated*"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","include-in-header":["extra_code.html"],"include-before-body":["header.html"],"css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"themes.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","page-layout":"full","title-block-banner":false,"theme":"flatly.scss","mainfont":"Tahoma","grid":{"sidebar-width":"0px","body-width":"1000px","margin-width":"0px","gutter-width":"1.5rem"},"title":"Theme & papers"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
