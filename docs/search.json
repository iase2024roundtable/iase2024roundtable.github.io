By exploring of the many ways data and people are connected, it is hoped we can generate inclusive approaches that:\n\nsupport students with diverse needs and physical challenges,\nacknowledge and validate indigenous and cultural knowledges related to data,\naddress the impact of social and economic factors,\nconsider creative ways to support learners within under resourced contexts,\nchallenge the status quo and inherent biases,\ntake an interdisciplinary perspective,\ninform the design of digital tools or resources, tasks, and modern learning - environments, and\ntake a humanistic stance.\n\nThrough a mixture of formats including extensive discussions in small groups, the meeting will advance current knowledge about conceptual frameworks, teaching methods, technology solutions, and curricular materials.\nTopics to be updated"
