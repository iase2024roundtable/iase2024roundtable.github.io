## Conference theme

The overall theme of the conference is *Connecting data and people for inclusive statistics and data science education*. 

Given that the creation and use of data is a human-driven process, this conference aims to discuss the inclusivity of the teaching and learning experiences for both students and teachers within statistics and data science. By exploring of the many ways data and people are connected, it is hoped we can generate inclusive approaches that: 

- support students with diverse needs and physical challenges, 
- acknowledge and validate indigenous and cultural knowledges related to data, 
- address the impact of social and economic factors,
- consider creative ways to support learners within under resourced contexts,
- challenge the status quo and inherent biases,
- take an interdisciplinary perspective,
- inform the design of digital tools or resources, tasks, and modern learning - environments, and
- take a humanistic stance.

Through a mixture of formats including extensive discussions in small groups, the meeting will advance current knowledge about conceptual frameworks, teaching methods, technology solutions, and curricular materials.
