## Introduction

The [International Association for Statistical Education (IASE)](https://iase-web.org/) is organising the IASE Roundtable Conference which will take place from 2 July to 5 July 2024. The conference will be in person. Previous IASE Roundtables have brought 40-50 folks from around the world and the host country to share their passion, expertise, and experiences in statistics and data science education.

The four-day Roundtable will focus on a unique theme: "**Connecting data and people for inclusive statistics and data science education**". Given that the creation and use of data is a human-driven process, this conference aims to discuss the inclusivity of the teaching and learning experiences for both students and teachers within statistics and data science.

We invite you to participate in this roundtable conference, to join us in sharing knowledge, questions, and ideas that enable us to learn from the work of colleagues from around the world and help to advance statistics and data science education. The conference program will be a mixture of papers, workshops, and poster sessions, coupled with opportunities for conversation in person.

## Participate in IASE 2024

It is possible to participate in the Roundtable in one of four roles: Paper presenter or co-author, Workshop organiser or co-organiser, Poster presenter; or Discussant leader. Papers are submitted and shared before the conference, and roundtables are (literally) formed for discussions and constructive feedback during the conference. Workshops and poster presentations provide further opportunities for discussing and reflecting on statistics and data science education. Discussant leaders should be statistics educators at any level, developers of educational technology, developers of statistics curricula, students of statistics education, or scholars in education or statistics with experience in statistics education.

The IASE 2024 Roundtable is an in-person conference where all participants assume one of four roles: Paper presenter, Workshop organiser, Poster presenter; or Discussant leader. The program has not been finalised but sessions will be held between 9am NZT and 5pm NZT on each of the four days of the conference. Participants are expected to attend and contribute to all sessions, working together over the four days to support and advance knowledge about conceptual frameworks, teaching methods, technology solutions, and curricular materials.

We understand that some participants may not be able to participate in the conference in person. For this reason, we will consider a virtual option for a small number of participants who wish to present a paper or poster. Participants under this virtual option, if offered, will be expected to attend and engage in all sessions and discussions (see program times above) in line with the goals of a roundtable. Registration fees for virtual participants will be adjusted accordingly. You can indicate your interest for this virtual option in the submission form.

We are now accepting applications for contributions to the IASE 2024 Roundtable. Please review the [Themes and papers page](themes.qmd) to find out more about how to make a submission.
