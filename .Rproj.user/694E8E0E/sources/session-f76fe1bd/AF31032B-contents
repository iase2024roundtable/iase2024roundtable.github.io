This venue is located within the beautiful and bustling suburb of Parnell, is close to the Auckland CBD and waterfront, and offers attendees the option of booking accommodation onsite for very reasonable rates. 

In your time outside of the conference, you can explore historic architecture, boutique shops, art galleries, head into the CBD or waterfront, or weather permitting (Auckland is known for its changeable weather, particularly during Winter!) take a stroll in the Parnell Rose Gardens or the Auckland Domain.

Most people visiting NZ must pay the NZD$35 International Visitor Levy. If you require a Visa, you can request an invitation letter for your Visa application by emailing [iase2024.roundtable@gmail.com](mailto:iase2024.roundtable@gmail.com) after registering for the conference.

## Travel

[Auckland International Airport](https://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/) is the main hub for travel in New Zealand, for both international and domestic flights. Unfortunately, there are currently no public transport options for getting from the airport to the conference venue or the Auckland CBD. Depending on your time of arrival, there should be plenty of  [taxis](https://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/transport/taxis-and-shuttles) available. You can also book [Super Shuttle](www.supershuttle.co.nz) for a direct ride from the airport to your accommodation, or use various [rideshare options](https://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/transport/rideshare) such as Uber.
