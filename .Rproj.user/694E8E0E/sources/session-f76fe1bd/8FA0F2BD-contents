## Travel

[Auckland International Airport](https://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/) is the main hub for travel in New Zealand, for both international and domestic flights. Unfortunately, there are currently no public transport options for getting from the airport to the conference venue or the Auckland CBD. Depending on your time of arrival, there should be plenty of  [taxis](https://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/transport/taxis-and-shuttles) available. You can also book [Super Shuttle](www.supershuttle.co.nz) for a direct ride from the airport to your hotel, or use various [rideshare options](https://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/transport/rideshare) such as Uber.

## Meals

Lunch and refreshments will be provided to in-person attendees on all five days of the conference (2-5 July) at the conference venue (included in in-person registration fees).

If you are staying at The Parnell Hotel, breakfast is included in your room rates. The hotel also has an onsite restaurant called Gladstones, which is open from X to X.
