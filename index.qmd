The [International Association for Statistical Education (IASE)](https://iase-web.org/) is organising the IASE Roundtable Conference which will take place from 2 July to 5 July 2024. The conference will be in person. Previous IASE Roundtables have brought 40-50 folks from around the world and the host country to share their passion, expertise, and experiences in statistics and data science education.

We invite you to participate in this roundtable conference, to join us in sharing knowledge, questions, and ideas that enable us to learn from the work of colleagues from around the world and help to advance statistics and data science education. The conference program will be a mixture of papers, workshops, and poster sessions, coupled with opportunities for conversation in person.
